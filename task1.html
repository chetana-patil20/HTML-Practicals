        <h1>Classic Margherita Pizza</h1>
        <p>Serves: 2–3 | Prep: 20 min (+1–2 hr dough rise) | Cook: 8–12 min</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>For the dough:
                <ol>
                    <li>300 g all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>1 tsp instant yeast</li>
                    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
                    <li>180 ml warm water</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>200 g canned crushed tomatoes or pizza sauce</li>
            <li>1–2 cloves garlic, minced (optional)</li>
            <li>200 g fresh mozzarella, torn or sliced</li>
            <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li>1–2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Semolina or cornmeal for dusting (optional)</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the dough: mix flour, yeast, and salt in a bowl. Add warm water and olive oil, stir until a shaggy dough forms, then knead 8–10 minutes until smooth. Cover and let rise until doubled (1–2 hours). (Or use store-bought dough.)</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 475–500°F (245–260°C). If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat; otherwise use a baking sheet, lightly dusted with semolina or cornmeal.</li>
            <li>Prepare the sauce: season crushed tomatoes with a pinch of salt, pepper, and the minced garlic if using. Keep it simple—no need to cook ahead.</li>
            <li>Shape the dough: divide dough into portions, press or roll into a 10–12 inch round on a floured surface, leaving a slightly thicker edge for the crust.</li>
            <li>Assemble: transfer the shaped dough to a pizza peel or baking sheet. Spread a thin layer of sauce over the base, leaving the edge free. Scatter torn mozzarella evenly and drizzle with a little olive oil.</li>
            <li>Bake: slide the pizza onto the preheated stone or put the baking sheet in the oven. Bake 8–12 minutes until the crust is golden and cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
            <li>Finish: remove from oven, scatter fresh basil leaves, drizzle with a little extra-virgin olive oil, slice, and serve immediately.</li>
            <li>Variations: add pepperoni, roasted vegetables, or swap mozzarella for burrata after baking for a richer topping.</li>
