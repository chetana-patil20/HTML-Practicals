        <p>Serves: 2 | Prep: 15 min | Cook: 10 min</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>500 g ground beef (80/20 blend) — makes 2 patties</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tsp Worcestershire sauce (optional)</li>
            <li>2 slices cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>2 burger buns</li>
            <li>1 tbsp butter (for toasting buns)</li>
            <li>Lettuce leaves</li>
            <li>1 tomato, sliced</li>
            <li>Onion slices (red or white)</li>
            <li>Pickles</li>
            <li>Ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Divide the ground beef into two equal portions and gently form into patties slightly wider than the buns. Do not overwork the meat.</li>
            <li>Season both sides with salt and pepper and add Worcestershire if using.</li>
            <li>Preheat a skillet or grill to medium-high and oil lightly. Cook the patties 3–4 minutes per side for medium, adjusting time for desired doneness.</li>
            <li>Place a slice of cheddar on each patty during the last minute of cooking and cover to melt.</li>
            <li>Spread butter on the bun cut sides and toast in a pan until golden.</li>
            <li>Assemble: spread sauces on buns, add lettuce, tomato, cheesy patty, onion, and pickles. Top and serve immediately.</li>
            <li>Optional: add bacon, avocado, or swap beef for a turkey or vegetarian patty.</li>
